1. Run "setFieldsDict" to set up "materials" and "DT" (thermal diffusivity) in accordance with the fluidDomain.stl
2. Run "wDissipationTempResidenceTauSimpleFoamV4FE" to calculate fields of velocity ("W"), pressure ("p"), Temperature and residence time.
3. Run "immersedElasticSolidFoam" to calculate fields of deflection ("U") and stress ("sigma")
