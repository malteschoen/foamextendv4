1. run "blockMesh"

2. Size and position the sink area by means of "sink.stl"

3. Calculate the amount of heat extracted/added. Start with a heating/cooling rate in W/cmÂ³, divide the rate by [the product of nominal density (= melt density) and nominal heat capacity (= melt heat capacity)]. The result is a cooling rate (negative) or heating rate (positive). Make sure to input this in "system/setFieldsDict"

4. Size and position the fluid and solid areas by means of "flowChannel.stl" or "inletChannel.stl"

5. Run "setFieldsDict" to set up "sink", "materials" and "DT" (thermal diffusivity) in accordance with the "flowChannel.stl" and/or "inletChannel.stl" and "sink.stl"

6. Run "wDissipationTempConcentrationResidenceBlockageSinkTauSimpleFoamV4FE" to calculate fields of velocity ("W"), pressure ("p"), temperature ("T"), concentration and residence time.
