1. run "blockMesh"

2. Size and position the fluid and solid areas by means of "flowChannel.stl" or "inletChannel.stl"

3. Run "setFieldsDict" to set up  "materials" and "DT" (thermal diffusivity) in accordance with the "flowChannel.stl" and/or "inletChannel.stl".

4. Run "wDissipationTempConcentrationResidenceBlockageSinkTauSimpleFoamV4FE" to calculate fields of velocity ("W"), pressure ("p"), temperature ("T"), concentration and residence time.
